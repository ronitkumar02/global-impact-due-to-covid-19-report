## Conclusion

We studied the spread of covid-19 among the countries and its impact on the global human lifestyle.
We saw that the outbreak of covid-19 resulted in the highest number of covid-19 cases and deaths in the united
states. It is comparatively low according to the population.
From the first objective we can conclude that majority covid outbreak was in united states followed by Brazil
and india respectively.
From the second objective, we can observe the you entries having most population are facing more outbreak to
covid-19 .
From the third objective, the most number of demise cases are being observed in united states followed by
Brazil even when India has more population then these countries and yet has head to head demise count as of
united kingdom and Mexico .
